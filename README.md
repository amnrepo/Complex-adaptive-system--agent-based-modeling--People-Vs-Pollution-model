Abstractâ€”Air pollution and population health is one of the most 
pressing environmental and public health issue contemporarily.
Economic development, fossil fuels, transportation/motorization,
urbanization, energy consumption and rapid population growth 
are major driving forces of air pollution in large cities, especially 
in megacities. Air pollution levels have been decreasing 
dramatically in developed countries in recent decades. However, 
in countries in transition and developing countries, levels of air 
pollution are still relatively high, though the levels have been 
gradually decreasing or have remained stable during rapid 
economic development. Several hundred epidemiological studies 
have emerged in recent years showing adverse health effects 
associated with short-term and long-term exposure to air 
pollutants. In this work, we have presented the agent based 
modeling system to explore the temporal behavior of the
population to ambient air pollution. The computed results are 
processed and visualized using the NetLogo modeling 
environment. The results shows the variation of the population 
density over time with the corresponding pollution exposure.

Steps to run the code.

1. Open CAS Project code.ipynb 
2. Run the cell/code under "#Connect PyNetlogo" to connect python with Netlogo. Make sure to verify the path of NetLogo model(Urban Suite - Pollution.nlogo) in this cell.
3. Run the code under "#Experiment-1" to execute experiment 1.
4. Run The 3 cells under "#Experiment-1 Plots" to plot the graph results experiment 1.
5. Run the code under "#Experiment-2" to execute experiment 2.
6. Run The 3 cells under "#Experiment-2 Plots" to plot the graph results from experiment 2.
7. Run the code under "#Experiment-3" to execute experiment 3.
8. Run The 3 cells under "#Experiment-3 Plots" to plot the graph results from experiment 3.
