Steps to run the code.

1. Open CAS Project code.ipynb 
2. Run the cell/code under "#Connect PyNetlogo" to connect python with Netlogo. Make sure to verify the path of NetLogo model(Urban Suite - Pollution.nlogo) in this cell.
3. Run the code under "#Experiment-1" to execute experiment 1.
4. Run The 3 cells under "#Experiment-1 Plots" to plot the graph results experiment 1.
5. Run the code under "#Experiment-2" to execute experiment 2.
6. Run The 3 cells under "#Experiment-2 Plots" to plot the graph results from experiment 2.
7. Run the code under "#Experiment-3" to execute experiment 3.
8. Run The 3 cells under "#Experiment-3 Plots" to plot the graph results from experiment 3.
9. END
